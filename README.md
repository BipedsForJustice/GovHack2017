# [On Track](https://rawgit.com/BipedsForJustice/GovHack2017/master/OnTrack/index.html)
[On Track](https://rawgit.com/BipedsForJustice/GovHack2017/master/OnTrack/index.html) is a web app that provides details of walking tracks on a map. It’s aimed at children so throughout development we gave consideration to language and features that will appeal to our younger audience. 

We seek to gamify going out and exploring great locations for younger South Australians. At this stage our product has a dozen tracks and we want to add incentives to reward people for exploring conservation parks, heritage sites or spotting shipwrecks. These landmarks are currently available but gamification with user profiles needs further time for development.

## On the horizon
Future development of On Track will include the ability to authenticate users, save data, unlock achievements and share photos. There is also the potential to partner with Tourism SA and for South Australian travel locations to be promoted within On Track.

We believe that an app like On Track will help encourage children to spend more time outdoors and get excited about the state that they live in. It’s going to be great watching kids like Melody get “on track” to explore and learn about South Australia.
